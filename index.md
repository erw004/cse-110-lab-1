### About me

I like a lot of things, especially watching movies and shows. My favorite show is **Cobra Kai**. Here is a review on [imdb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7221388/). Below is one of my favorite quotes since I need to include one in quoting text for credit.

> Strike fast, strike hard, no mercy!

I really resonate with the messaging of the show and really enjoy the comedic bits. So, like the show, I preach sticking up for yourself no matter what and being light-hearted.

As I've told you, I like movies and shows. Here's some shows I planned to watch this year. I've marked the ones I've watched so far.

- [x] Game of Thrones
- [ ] Squid Game
- [x] Ozark
- [x] Cobra Kai
- [ ] Dark

### About me as a programmer

My favorite language is **Python** because of its ease and versatility. Additionally, its the language we use for AI/ML, which are fields I want to further pursue in career or potentially academic research.

Because I need quoting code, I will add a snippet of Hello World below in Python.

```
print("Hello World")
```

Since I need a relative link, here is a link to the [README](README.md)

If you care, here are my top 3 programming languages:

1. Python
2. C++
3. Java
